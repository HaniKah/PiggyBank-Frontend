---------PiggyBank-------------
Piggybank is a budget tracker application. it allows you to track your expenses, income and even set budgets to make sure you have some savings by the end of the month. it is designed to fulfill the needs of users who are most probably employees or students, however, it welcomes everyone to use it. 

The application is the final project created during the Bootcamp from "WBS Coding School" in Berlin. It took two weeks with a group of 5 students to be finished, after that some design and slight changes were made to make sure to be good-presented.

PiggyBank was created with MERN Stack with the use of MUI and vanilla CSS in different parts, please make sure to visit the website here : https://piggybanktracker.netlify.app
